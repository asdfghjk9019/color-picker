# color-picker

This is maid for bigger purpase and that ok, but this is already a pretty nice thing that I didnt find much in other resources.
(I should have included the resources that i did find and use but forget it)

also if you think that my coding is bad or unsafe (in terms of memory leeks) please notify me.

**small-issue**:<br>
the radial color picker does not have a smooth edge, if you have an idea for how to fix it ill be happy to know.
